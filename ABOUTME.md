Hi, this is Daniel Quer. I am 28 years old, I work as a Senior BI Analyst at Foodspring. I have been using SQL since August 2017, and actively contributing to data modeling since June 2019.
I haven't been to the course yet unfortunately, but I am very excited to meet my peers and of course the teachers of the Data Part-Time Analytics Course at Ironhack.

I love sunny days.

This will create a conflict, my friend.
